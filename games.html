                        Meet <em>Triku</em>, a flying platform-adventure game that's made for fans of <em>Monster World IV</em> and <em>Shantae</em>. Set in an undescribed world, you must work through tasks with wide difficulty for each area and cute spooky characters to dialog to for more information about the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Development began in <time datetime="2023-07">July 2023</time> and Triku being a ghost is a technical decision. Some of the characters in the game are named after streets, lanes, roads and avenues. During on, I removed the concept of poetry because it's likely boring and started expand on the game by creating new characters and areas.
